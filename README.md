[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/patferguson/scheduler-for-toggl.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/patferguson/scheduler-for-toggl)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/patferguson/scheduler-for-toggl/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/patferguson/scheduler-for-toggl?branch=develop)

Web tool to streamline adding regular schedule entries to the Toggl time tracking service. Built in React and Redux.

Use this tool online at: [https://scheduler-for-toggl.ferguson.cloud/](https://scheduler-for-toggl.ferguson.cloud/) <- NOTE 2017/09/29 - CORS for the Toggl API has not yet been configured for this URL so the site does not work at this time.

## Running the project

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if edits are made.<br>
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Building the project

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn run build`

Ensure the `build/` folder is correctly initialised first-time by running `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`. See: [Git Submodules docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

The `build/` folder may be used to display the compiled site with GitHub Pages.

#### Submitting updated builds

First time setup:

Navigate to the `build/` folder.

Run `git submodule update --remote` to update the `build/` folder code to latest.

Run `git checkout master` to ensure the correct branch is used.

**Subsequent builds**

Navigate to the base project folder, ensure the `master` branch is checked out and updated.

Run `rm -rf build/static/` to ensure the old assets are deleted, as each file will have a hash appended to the name.

Run `yarn build` from the base project folder.

Run `cd build/ && git add . && cd ..` to stage the new built file changes.

Run `git push --recurse-submodules=check` to push the submodule changes, this will also push any local commits.
